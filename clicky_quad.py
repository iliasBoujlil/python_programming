=====
Write a function that will complete the mostly written turtle program 
below. All of the turtle parts have been written for you; you will just
need to write one function. The completed program draws circles every 
time the user clicks on the screen. Each circle will be a different color
based on where the screen is clicked:

Check out the animated gif!

Again, the program is already mostly written for you. Just finish the 
function specified by "TODO:" in the comments below.

# turn animation of turtles off

# set the width and height of our screen
width, height = 500, 500
wn.setup(width, height)

# TODO:
# Create a function called get_quadrant_color:
# 
# a. it should have two parameters, click_x and click_y
# b. the parameters represent the coordinates of where the mouse was when
#    when the screen was clicked
# c. the function should return a string representing one of the following
#    four colors: red, green, blue and yellow
# d. determine what color to give back based on what quadrant the user
#    clicked on:
#    * red - upper right
#    * green - lower right
#    * blue - upper left
#    * yellow - lower left
#
# YOU DO NOT HAVE TO CALL THE FUNCTION
#
# YOU CAN ASSUME THAT THE x and y COORDINATES WILL BE PASSED IN TO IT
# AUTOMATICALLY BY THE PARTS OF THE PROGRAM THAT ARE ALREADY WRITTEN
# =====================================

# (define get_quadrant_color here!)
